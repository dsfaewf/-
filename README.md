 Alzheimer's disease, a chronic degenerative brain disorder, is one of the most common causes of dementia and is notoriously difficult to treat completely.
 Current Alzheimer’s medications focus on improving cognitive functions and alleviating symptoms, but a definitive cure remains out of reach. 
 While there are various factors that can contribute to Alzheimer's disease, our primary focus is on addressing forgetfulness and depression as primary triggers.
 The latency period for Alzheimer’s is 15-20 years, making it crucial to prevent the disease by addressing early signs of forgetfulness in younger generations.
 Mental and behavioral symptoms such as depression are contributing factors to early-onset Alzheimer’s, highlighting the need for cognitive function management.

### Objectives
- The goal of this project:
-- Prevent Alzheimer's disease with an intelligent digital therapeutic game.
- The target audience:
-- Includes all age groups who exhibit symptoms
- Main Motivation:
-- By recalling their past experiences through these quizzes, users can improve their memory and cognitive abilities.
-- Enhancing cognitive function not only helps prevent Alzheimer’s but also boosts self-esteem through regular self-reflection during journal writing, which can reduce the incidence of depression.
